                            lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                            This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                            observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
                            For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
                            with respect to the current state of the instance.

                            The value should be a CamelCase string.

                            Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                            useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
