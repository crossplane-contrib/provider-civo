                            lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                            This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                            Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                            useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
